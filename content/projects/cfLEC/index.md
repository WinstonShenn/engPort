## Project Overview

During the 24-25 FSAE season, I helped manufacture parts of the carbon fiber aero package such as the hood and undertray at the Leading Edge Composities Facility. During this process I learned more about the pre-preg lamination process, as well as other techniques for carbon fiber part manufacturing eg. wet layups.
